Absolutely! You can use both staleTime and cacheTime together in React Query, as they serve different purposes:

ðŸ”¥ Difference Between staleTime and cacheTime
Property	Purpose	Effect
staleTime	Defines how long data stays fresh before becoming stale	Until the staleTime expires, React Query won't trigger a refetch
cacheTime	Controls how long unused data stays in memory before being removed	After cacheTime expires, the cached data is deleted
âš¡ Example Using Both:
tsx
const { data } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['posts'],
  queryFn: fetchPosts,
  staleTime: 60000, // Data stays fresh for 1 minute
  cacheTime: 300000, // Unused cache remains for 5 minutes
});
âœ… What Happens Here?
First 1 Minute (staleTime: 60000) â†’ Cached data is considered fresh, so React Query won't refetch.

After 1 Minute â†’ Data becomes staleâ€”next interaction triggers a refetch.

Before 5 Minutes (cacheTime: 300000) â†’ If no component is using the query, the cached data remains in memory.

After 5 Minutes â†’ The cache is completely removed from memory.

This setup reduces unnecessary network requests while keeping frequently used data available. ðŸš€
